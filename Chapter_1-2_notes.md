## Introduction
Present problems and their solutions:
Marathon runner tracking

Railway car inventory

Supermarket inventory

The solutoins for these problems iteratively combined and become the bar code,
achieving what was thought impossible before. Now ubiquitous and in the background of society, it's stand to show engineering is embed within our culture

## Chapter 1
Mixing and matching
### Engineering mindset
1. See structure where there's none, engineers must visualize and produce structures through combination of rules, models and their instincts. Done with the following questions:
  - What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
  - How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
  - What’s new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
  - Who cares? If you’re successful, what difference will it make?
  - What are the risks and the payoffs?
  - How much will it cost? How long will it take?
  - What are the midterm and final “exams” to check for success?
2. Work with constraints , whether temporal or financial, know the limit of applications and design around it
3. Work with trade-offs, balance needs and demands and practicalities.

### Science and engineering

Science is unbounded by its applications and often relies on objectivity. Engineering use science as tool and lies wholeheartedly in the subjectivity realm
